# Full Stack Food App
Each year, roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption gets lost or wasted. Much of this food is edible and is thrown away instead of distributed to people who could use it. Those in need, including the homeless and those who rely on food banks and meal centers, would benefit from a system where good food is shared instead of wasted. 

Our app aims to connect people at the community level, allowing those with extra food to “post” what they have in real-time so that other users could either get it themselves or help bring the food to food banks or local homeless shelters. There would be different types of accounts so that restaurants could distinguish themselves from a household or a “runner” (someone who could help deliver the extra food). 

The backend is built in JavaScript with NodeJS, while the Frontend was created with Java in Android Studio. Additionally, there are web components written in JavaScript and HTML.
